# Climate DataLab: A Public Resource for Climate Model Education

---

## Welcome to Climate DataLab!

Learning how to work with datasets from climate models can be daunting, even for those with existing technical expertise. **Climate DataLab** provides "end-to-end" training on all aspects of the process:

    Understanding the fundamentals of how climate models are set up
    Basics of file formats used for storing climate model output (netCDF)
    Coordinate systems and dealing with 1D vs. 2D latitude and longitude information
    Calendar systems employed by climate models
    Scenarios of future climate change
    Naming schemes for both climate models and model experiments: from scenarios t o MIPs
    Climate model large ensembles
    Model "parameterizations" and inter-model physical differences


👉 Check out our website at [www.climate-datalab.org](http://www.climate-datalab.org) for much more information!

## 🎯 Climate DataLab Goals

- To increase the usability of climate model output by the broader environmental science community as well as other interested groups
- To foster learning across demographics historically underrepresented in climate science
- To provide transparent, reproducible, and modular code-based workflows for education and research, as well as other applications

## 🛠️ Getting Started: What You'll Need

Most tutorials are written in **Python** or **R**. Some run directly on [Binder](https://mybinder.org), while others may require a local setup:

- [Install Python](https://realpython.com/installing-python/)
- [Install RStudio](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/)

> _Tip: RStudio can be used for both R **and** Python code!_
