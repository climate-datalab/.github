# 🌍 Climate DataLab: A Public Resource for Climate Model Education

---

## 👋 Welcome to Climate DataLab!

Learning how to work with datasets from climate models can be daunting, even for those with strong technical backgrounds. **Climate DataLab** offers clear, end-to-end training in:
- Climate model fundamentals
- Common file formats (e.g., NetCDF)
- Coordinate systems (1D vs 2D grids)
- Model calendar systems
- Climate change scenarios and MIPs
- Model naming conventions
- Large ensembles
- Model physics and parameterizations

👉 Explore more at our website: [www.climate-datalab.org](http://www.climate-datalab.org)

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Increase the usability of climate model output across the environmental sciences
- Promote access to climate science for historically underrepresented groups
- Provide transparent, reproducible, and modular code-based workflows for education and research

---

## 🛠️ Getting Started

Most tutorials are written in **Python** or **R**. Some run directly on [Binder](https://mybinder.org), while others may require a local setup:

- [Install Python](https://realpython.com/installing-python/)
- [Install RStudio](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/)

> _Tip: RStudio can be used for both R **and** Python code!_
